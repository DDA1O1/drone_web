The Tello SDK connects to the aircraft through a Wi-Fi UDP port, allowing users to control the 
aircraft with text commands. After downloading and installing Python, download the Tello3.py file 
via the link: https://dl-cdn.ryzerobotics.com/downloads/tello/20180222/Tello3.py. 
* Tello3.py is a sample program based on python that establish a UPD communication port, which can 
implement simple interaction with Tello, including sending SDK instructions to Tello and receiving Tello 
information. Tello3.py is for reference only and user can develop more.
Architecture 
Use Wi-Fi to establish a connection between the Tello and PC, Mac, or mobile device. 
Send Command & Receive Response
Tello IP: 192.168.10.1 UDP PORT: 8889 <<- ->> PC/Mac/Mobile
Step 1: Set up a UDP client on the PC, Mac, or mobile device to send and receive messages from 
the Tello via the same port. 
Step 2: Before sending any other commands, send “command” to the Tello via UDP PORT 8889 to 
initiate SDK mode.
Receive Tello State 
Tello IP: 192.168.10.1 ->> PC/Mac/Mobile UDP Server: 0.0.0.0 UDP PORT: 8890
Step 3: Set up a UDP server on the PC, Mac, or mobile device and check the message from IP 0.0.0.0 
via UDP PORT 8890. Steps 1 and 2 must be completed before attempting step 3. For more 
details, refer to the Tello State section.
* Refer to the Tello State section for details.
Receive Tello Video Stream
Tello IP: 192.168.10.1 ->> PC/Mac/Mobile UDP Server: 0.0.0.0 UDP PORT: 11111
Step 4: Set up a UDP server on the PC, Mac, or mobile device and check the message from IP 0.0.0.0 
via UDP PORT 11111. 
Step 5: Send “streamon” to the Tello via UDP PORT 8889 to start streaming. Steps 1 and 2 must be 
completed before attempting step 5. 
Tello Command Types and Results
The Tello SDK includes three basic command types.
Control Commands (xxx)
Returns “ok” if the command was successful.
Returns “error” or an informational result code if the command failed. 
Set Command (xxx a) to set new sub-parameter values
Returns “ok” if the command was successful.
Returns “error” or an informational result code if the command failed.
